ca65none
========

This is a reimplementation in ca65 macros of the mnemonics for all
official opcodes and useful unofficial opcodes of the MOS 6502 CPU.
It was used as a proof of concept before doing the same for SPC700
(Super NES audio CPU) in [lorom-template] and the SM83 (Game Boy CPU)
in [ca83].  It may prove helpful to those attempting to make a 6502
assembler within some other assembler.
