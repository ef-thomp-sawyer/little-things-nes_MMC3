FME-7 big work RAM test
=======================
![Result is 00 01 02 03 repeating, meaning 32 KiB](docs/fme7ramtest-screenshot.png)

As of March 2015, NES emulators disagree on how much RAM at $6000 a
game using Sunsoft's FME-7 mapper IC can see.

FME-7 register 8 sets both the bank mapped to $6000 and whether
$6000 is ROM or RAM.  Even if this register is set to RAM, the FME-7
still outputs the bank number on PRG A18-A13.  This was confirmed by
l_oliveira on forums.nesdev.com, who rewired an FME-7 board to use a
larger memory.

Replacing the 6264 (8Kx8 SRAM) on the NES-BTR or JSROM PCB with a
62256 (32Kx8 SRAM) gives the NES program four 8K RAM banks to use.
This would provide ample space for a Z-machine or BASIC interpreter.
    
Run this test on a _Batman: Return of the Joker_ or other FME-7
board with PRG ROM, CHR ROM, and WRAM.  To rewire it to use a 62256,
route signals from the FME-7 to the appropriate pins on the RAM:

* FME-7 pin 36: PRG A13 output
* 62256 pin 26: A13 input (+CE on 6264; you'll need to cut this) 
* FME-7 pin 34: PRG A14 output
* 62256 pin 1: A14 input (not connected on 6264)

Expected results
----------------
With 6264 (by default):

    00: C0 C0 C0 C0 C0 C0 C0 C0
    08: C0 C0 C0 C0 C0 C0 C0 C0

With 62256:

    00: C0 C1 C2 C3 C0 C1 C2 C3
    08: C0 C1 C2 C3 C0 C1 C2 C3
