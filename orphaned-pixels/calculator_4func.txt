A cheap calculator has four functions that we can separate into two
pairs, each the opposite of the other.  Add and subtract, multiply
and divide.

Likewise, this character has two pairs of limbs: left and right arms,
left and right legs. (show typical human boy)

A 6502, on the other hand, can't multiply or divide, only add and
subtract. It's like getting around with just your arms.
