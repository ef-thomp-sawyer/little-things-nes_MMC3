Playing cards
=============

Suits
-----

1. Chinese suits: tens of 10K (十), 10K (万), coins, rolls of coins
2. Latin suits: swords, cups, coins, sticks
3. German suits: leaves, hearts, bells, acorns
4. French suits: spades, hearts, diamonds, clubs

Cups were originally upside-down 10K symbols.

Clubs are called "clubs" after the Portuguese variant of Latin suits
where sticks resemble a billy club.  The name stuck after the
transition from stick to clover.

Different games rank the suits differently.  Rolls of coins outrank
coins in Chinese suits and Big Two, whereas diamonds outrank clubs in
Bridge bidding.

Ranks of suit cards
-------------------

Chinese suited decks have 38 cards: 1-9 of coins, rolls of coins,
and 10K; and 2-9 of tens, hundred 10K, thousand 10K, and 10K^2.
Zero and half coin cards were added later.  Many games with Chinese
suits rank coins in reverse order, with 1 beating 2, 2 beating 3,
and 8 beating 9.  Later three-suited decks lacked most of the tens
except the thousand 10K; Mahjong tiles are based on these decks.

As for face cards (J, C, Q, K) in European suited decks:

* The earliest Persian, Arabian, and Egyptian cards had 10 pip cards
  and two face cards: king and vizier (magistrate/deputy).
* German decks have an Ober (upper knave) instead of a queen, which
  corresponds to the knight/cavalier in 56- and 78-card decks.
* In decks for Minchiate, red suits (cups and coins) have a maid
  instead of a page/jack.
* Portuguese games have jack outrank queen because jack represents
  a knight and queen represents a sota (maid).
* Decks for Aluette (which uses Latin suits) have a female knight
  (Cavalière), as a compromise between knight and queen.

Trump and fool
--------------

Tarot/tarock games use 21 numbered cards of a neutral suit called
"trumps" (name akin to "triumph") and another suitless card, the
Fool.  The Fool evolved into the Joker in 53- or 54-card decks.

Decks for Minchiate have 35 numbered trumps and 5 unnumbered
trumps (star, moon, sun, world, and trumpet).

cardguys
--------

The cardguys pattern presented here portrays the jack, knight,
queen, king, and fool as two parents and their three children.
I have named three of them: the jack is Jack, the fool is Jess
(short for either Jessica or jester), and the queen is Madge
(short for Margaret or majesty).  Kroc Camen (`@kroc@mstdn.social`)
[recommended][Kroc toot] "Roy" for the king.

Further research options for cardguys:

- Name the knight
- Draw Jill, a Minchiate maid
- Draw a set of 21 trumps
