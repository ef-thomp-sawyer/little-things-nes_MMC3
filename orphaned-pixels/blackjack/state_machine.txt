Blackjack game states
=====================

Approach
--------
A sign on the table indicates the variant:

- Minimum bet is 10 cio
- Four decks
- Blackjack pays 3:2
- Insurance: A up pays 2:1; 10 up pays 11:1
- Dealer stands on 18 or hard 17
- Hole card used
- Surrender if no dealer blackjack
- Split aces may be resplit as room allows and not hit

Find a table with a minimum bet between 1/50 and 1/20 of player bankroll.

Wager
-----
```
If less than one-fourth of the shoe remains or the game uses one deck:
    Reshuffle
Choose a multiple of the ante no greater than bankroll
Move this amount from bankroll to wager
If not all bases are filled and ante does not exceed bankroll:
    Offer another hand
```

Insure
------
```
Each player draws two cards
Dealer draws one upcard and one hole card
If dealer upcard is A or 10 and ante does not exceed bankroll:
    Offer "Insure"
        Move the greater of half total wager and bankroll from bankroll to insurance
```

Insurance payout
----------------
In hole-card blackjack, insurance payout happens before player opening.  In no-hole blackjack, more common outside North America, insurance payout happens before dealer hit.
```
If insurance was taken:
    Reveal hole card
If dealer's total is 21:
    Reveal hole card
    For each player who does not have blackjack (10-A not resulting from split):
        Discard hand and wager
    If dealer upcard is A:
        Add 2 times insurance to bankroll
        Return insurance to bankroll
    If dealer upcard is 10:
        Add 11 times insurance to bankroll
        Return insurance to bankroll
Otherwise:
    Discard insurance
```

Player opening
--------------
```
If hand is 10 and A: Player has blackjack
    End phase
If hand value is 15-17 and upcard is high and either the hole card is not revealed or dealer's total is less than 21:
    Offer "Surrender"
        Add half hand's wager to bankroll
        Discard hand and wager
If wager exceeds bankroll:
    End phase
If hand is a pair, not 5-5 or 10-10, and a base is open:
    Offer "Split"
        Move 2nd card to hand at open base
        Move wager's value from bankroll to new hand's wager
        Draw one card on each
        If moved card was A: Decline Hit
        Disqualify both hands for blackjack
Otherwise:
    Offer "Double"
        Move wager's value from bankroll and add it to wager
        Draw one card
        Decline Hit
```

Player hit
----------
```
While total is less than 21 and hand has fewer than 7 cards and hit not declined:
    Offer "Hit"
        Draw one card
If hand total exceeds 21:
    Discard hand and wager
```

Dealer hit
----------
```
Reveal hole card
If no player remains: End phase
While total is less than 18 and hard total is less than 17 and hand has fewer than 7 cards:
    Draw one card
```

Payout
------
```
If player has blackjack and dealer does not: Win at 3:2
If dealer total exceeds 21: Win at 1:1
If player or dealer has 7 cards: Change total to 21
If dealer total exceeds player total: Lose
If player total exceeds dealer total: Win at 1:1
Otherwise: Push at 0:1
