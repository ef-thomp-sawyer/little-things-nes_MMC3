gmewav
======

**gmewav** is a program that converts chiptunes and tracker music to
stereo RIFF WAVE (wav) files.  It can read any format supported by
Game_Music_Emu (GME) or Dynamic Universal Music Bibliotheque (DUMB).

Dependencies
------------
Building requires a C compiler, GNU Make, and the header files for
GME and DUMB.  You can install all these on Ubuntu with this command:

    sudo apt install build-essential libdumb1-dev libgme-dev

Installation
------------
From a terminal or Command Prompt:

    make install PREFIX=~/.local

Usage
-----
usage: `gmewav [options] vgmfile wavfile`
    
Options:

* `-h, -?, --help`: show this usage info
* `-t LENGTH`: render `LENGTH` seconds of audio (default: 150.0)
* `-f LENGTH`: fade out the last `LENGTH` seconds (default: 0.0)
* `-m MOVEMENT`: render movement `MOVEMENT` (default: 1)
* `-M VOICES`: mute `VOICES` (e.g. `-M 1,3,6-8`)
* `-S VOICES`: solo: play only `VOICES`

GME supports vgm, gym, spc, sap, nsf, nsfe, ay, gbs, hes, kss.
Some formats support multiple movements, such as NSF; others don't.
If no channels are muted or soloed, and GME detects five seconds of
silence, GME may end the output before the time specified in `-t`.

DUMB supports it, xm, s3m, and mod.  No formats support multiple
movements.

If the output file is `-` (a single hyphen), `gmewav` instead
writes 44100 Hz stereo 16-bit signed native endian audio to standard
output, suitable for piping into a command-line audio output program.
The shell script `scripts/gmeplay.sh` shows an example of how to pipe
into PulseAudio's `paplay`.

Limits
------

* DUMB: Starting from a particular frame in the order table is
  not yet supported.
* DUMB: Changing the interpolation type is not yet supported.
* List of filename extensions routed to GME is hardcoded.  Though I
  could try loading a file with GME and pass unrecognized files to
  other readers, I still need to enumerate extensions for `--help`,
  and functions using `gme_type_t` can list only the console that
  each format represents, not its typical extension.
* List of filename extensions routed to DUMB is hardcoded.  Debian
  and Ubuntu still distribute a version of DUMB from before kode54
  added `dumb_load_any()`.
* Cannot insert tags for title, artist, etc. in output.  Not all
  players can read the same tag chunks, especially those bundled with
  popular operating systems.
* No way to turn off a particular reader at build time.

License
-------

* gmewav: zlib license
* DUMB: zlib license, with several joke clauses that have since been
  revoked
* GME: GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1 or later
