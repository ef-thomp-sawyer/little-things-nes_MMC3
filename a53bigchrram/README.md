Action 53 CHR bank test
=======================

![Screenshot of expected result. RAM size: 32K; FCEUX bug: No](docs/a53bigchrram-screenshot.png)

*Action 53* is an anthology of small video games for NES developed by
the devoted hobbyists in the NESdev community.  The cartridges use a
custom mapper that can simulate common discrete logic mappers, such
as those on Nintendo's NROM, CNROM, UNROM, and AOROM circuit boards.
This mapper has been assigned iNES mapper #28.

The first two volumes of *Action 53* only ever used 8 KiB of CHR RAM,
meaning the CNROM mode went untested in many implementations of the
Action 53 mapper.  In particular, the FCEUX emulator's implementation
was defective in that it delayed writes to the CHR bank register
until the next write to another register (PRG bank, mode, or outer
PRG).  This defect was reported to FCEUX's bug tracker as [bug 779],
and a fix was checked into [FCEUX SVN] in r3339.
