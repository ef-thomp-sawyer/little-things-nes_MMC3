This is a very basic terminal emulator useful for BASIC interpreters,
interactive fiction, and other programs for the Nintendo
Entertainment System using the keyboard adapter designed by
tpw_rules.

Features:

* 25 lines on NTSC or 30 lines on PAL NES or Dendy
* Each line is 224 pixels of proportional font
* Automatic word wrapping
* Fixed position status bar at top with activity throbber
* Can set one line of text in about 22,000 cycles
* VRAM uploads happen in the background through NMI and IRQ

It uses FME-7 interrupts to change CHR banks mid-screen.  For an
explanation of the display architecture, see `docs/boldly_going.md`.

Subroutines
===========

`term_init`
-----------
Sets up the terminal and clears the screen.

`term_cls`
-----------
Clears the screen.

`term_putc`
-----------
Writes the character in A to the terminal.  A should be a printable
ASCII character ($20-$7F) or a newline ($0A).  If a newline or word
wrap causes the bottom visible line of text to be filled, the scroll
is advanced to the next line.  Preserves Y; trashes $04-$0D.

`term_puts`
-----------
Writes the NUL-terminated string at address (A << 8 | Y) (AAYY) to
the terminal.  Trashes $04-$0D.  Returns $00-$01 pointing to the NUL
byte at the end of the string.

Usage example:

    lda #>hello_msg
    ldy #<hello_msg
    jsr term_puts

`term_puts0`
-----------
Writes the NUL-terminated string whose address is stored at $00-$01
to the terminal.  Trashes $04-$0D.  Returns $00-$01 pointing to the
NUL byte at the end of the string.

`term_flush`
------------
Writes the output buffer to the terminal without advancing to the
next line.  If A is nonzero, the line is drawn in inverse video
(white on black).  Trashes $04-$0D.

`term_discard_line`
-------------------
Clears the output buffer.  Useful for a message that has been
flushed with intent to replace, such as "MORE" in a pager.

`term_remeasure`
----------------
Recalculates the word wrap state.  Use this if you have modified
`term_buf` or `term_length` other than through `term_putc`.

`term_gets`
-----------
Collects characters entered by the user into a line of text.  It
calls `term_getc`, which you must provide, and responds to these
values returned in A:

* $20-$7F: Add this ASCII character at end of output buffer
* $08: Remove last character from output buffer
* $0D: Finish

The characters that have already been printed on this line before
the call to `term_gets` form the prompt.  The user cannot backspace
into the prompt.

`term_set_status`
-----------------
Replaces the text in the status bar with the NUL-terminated string at
address (A << 8 | Y) (AAYY).  The part before the first tab character
($09) is left-aligned; the rest is right-aligned.

Global variables
================

`tvSystem`
----------
Set by `term_init` to 0 for NTSC, 1 for PAL NES, or 2 for Dendy.

`last_PPUCTRL`
--------------
If bit 7 is true, the NMI handler will execute automatically.  This
NMI handler copies the last line of text to video memory and prepares
the IRQ engine to manage the screen display.

`term_buf`
----------
Output buffer containing ASCII characters.  It is not NUL terminated.
After `term_gets`, it contains the prompt followed by the input.

`term_length`
-------------
Total number of characters in `term_buf`, including the prompt and
the input.

`term_prompt_length`
--------------------
Number of characters in the prompt of `term_buf`.  After a call to
`term_gets`, this will equal the value that was in `term_length`
before the call.

`irq_handler`
-------------
2-byte vector to current IRQ handler.

`nmi_handler`
-------------
2-byte vector to current NMI handler.

`last_PPUCTRL`
--------------
If bit 7 is set, the `nmi_handler` gets called every NMI.

`nmis`
------
Low 8 bits of the number of NMIs that have occurred.  This is
incremented whether or not `last_PPUCTRL` is on.

`term_busy`
-----------
The NMI handler checks this every 16th time it runs (3 to 4 Hz),
sets it to zero, and updates a throbber at the right side of the
status line.  If `term_busy` was nonzero, the throbber is cycled
among frames of animation.  Otherwise, the throbber disappears.
Use this as a "watchdog" for your application's processing.

`cursor_y`
----------
This counts the total number of lines of text mod 30.
