This demo is a tool to explore gestures on the Power Pad that could be useful for a game that isn't necessarily themed around track or dance.

Components
----------

It shows these, from front to back:

- Circles on currently pressed sensors
- Current centroid position
- Lerped trail behind centroid
- Order of pressing and releasing

### Circles on currently pressed sensors

Color: white

For each of the 12 sensors, while the sensor is held, draw one solid circle at the sensor's center.

### Current centroid position

Color: yellow

During each frame in which at least one sensor is held, calculate the centroid of all pressed sensor positions.  If at least two sensors are pressed, draw a Secchi-Whipple circle, with quadrants 1 and 3 black, at this centroid.

### Lerped trail behind centroid

Color: white

Each frame, move a lead ring 1/4 of the way to the centroid, or if no sensors are held, toward the centroid's most recent position.  If 8 frames have elapsed with no held, make the lead ring invisible and then move it directly to the centroid on next press.

Draw the positions 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 frmaes old, using ring, small ring, and dot sprites.  To avoid crowding artifacts, do not draw positions within 3 pixels of a visible centroid.

### Order of pressing and releasing

Colors: blue and red

Show a ticker in a 192x16-pixel stripe below the pad.

- If a button is pressed, draw it in the bottom 8 pixels of the stripe.
- If a button is released, draw it in the top 8 pixels of the stripe.
- If at least one press or release has happened in the past 6 frames, move the ticker to the left by 4 pixels per frame.
- Destroy a transition that reaches the left side.
- Destroy more than 8 rises or 8 falls.
