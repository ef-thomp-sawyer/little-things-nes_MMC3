Grid floor demo
===============

This demo shows just how 80s the NES can look.  It uses raster
effects to bend a set of vertical lines and draw horizontal lines
over them to form a grid.

One version runs on the NROM-128 board (16 KiB PRG ROM and 8 KiB
CHR ROM).  The other version runs on an NROM-128 board modified
with CHR RAM.  The latter version contains 3 KiB of data, making
it a 4K intro.
